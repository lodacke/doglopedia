            <p><b>What Happened, Miss Simone?</b> is a 2015 American biographical documentary film about Nina Simone directed by Liz Garbus.
                 The film opened the 2015 Sundance Film Festival. The screening was followed by a tribute performance by John Legend. 
                 The film was released by Netflix on June 26, 2015. 
                It was nominated for Best Documentary Feature at the 88th Academy Awards.</p>
        
            <h3>Reception </h3>
        
                <p>On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 89% based on 46 reviews, and an average rating of 7.90/10. The website's critical consensus states, 
                    "What Happened, Miss Simone? is a compelling -- albeit necessarily incomplete -- overview of its complex subject's singular artistic legacy and fascinating life". 
                    On Metacritic it has a score of 75 out of 100 based on reviews from 12 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".
                    Indiewire gave the film a B grade. <br> Michael Hogan wrote for Vanity Fair that, "The risk of making a documentary of a towering artist is that, by explaining her, you only end up diminishing her. 
                    Not Nina Simone—not this time. In Liz Garbus's telling, Simone's talent and personality shine through, as gloriously singular, and uncontrollable, as ever.
                    "Manohla Dargis of The New York Times cited the film's relevance, calling it an "often electric, bracingly urgent documentary." </p>
